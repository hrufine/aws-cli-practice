1. IAM - 
    IAM - Security Tools
    a)IAM Credentias Report
    b)IAM Access Advisor
2. Billing set up ,threshold has been set up
3)EC2
    a)EC2
    b)EBS
    c)ELB
    d)ASG
 EC2 sizing - Linux,Windows,Mac OS , CPU,RAM,Storage(EBS,EFS or EC2 instance Store)
              Network card(speed),Public IP,Firewall(security group)
              Bootstrap Script(first launch - EC2 User Data)
    In this course - t2.micro - 750 hours per month
AMI(Amazone machine Image)
    EC2 Instance Types - right now 7 types.
    EC2 - Security Groups (like Firewall)
        Security Groups only contain Allow rules.
    Classic Ports - 22 - SSH(secure shell)
                    21 - FTP
                    22 - SFTP(secure file transfer protocol using ssh)
                    80 - HTTP - access unsecured websites
                    443 -  HTTPS - access secured websites
                    3389 - RDP - log into Windows instance
    AWS - Reserved instances

    EC2 On Demand - billing per seconf after first minute
                    Other OS -e every hour
    EBS(Elastic block store)
    Generally EBS cannot multi attached, but for io1/io2 family EBS multi attach exists,
    eg:for clustered linux applications)
4)AMI (Amazone Machine Image)
5)EC2 Instance Store - better I/O (good for temporary store, direct storage in server)
6)EFS - Elastic file system (network file system)
    a)NFSv4.1 Network protocol (standard protocol)
    b)Only for linux and cannot mount on Windows
    c)POSIX file system, linux has a standard file API
    d)File system scales automatically, pay per use, no capsity planning
7)EBS vs EFS
8)Load Balance
    a)Classic Loan Balancer - old version
    b)ALB(Applications Load Balancer) 
    c)NLB - Network Load Balance

    =>Sticki Session via cookie
    =>SSL Intro for configuration
    =>Cross Zone load balancing
    =>Connection Draining
9) ASG - Automaic Scaling
